            <H3>Our Mission</H3>
            <p>Build Early Ed strengthens the continuum of care for youth by connecting New Mexicans to
                Head Start programs. We help New Mexicans enroll their children into Head Start, earn higher
                education credentials, and connect with local advocates to build Head Start programs in their
                community. Together, we can build the future of early childhood education.
